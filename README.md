## Stretch goals

**Size changes of paddles**

When a player scores, his/her paddle increases in height. At the same time, the another player's paddle height decreases. 

**Declare a winner**

When one of the players loses his/her paddle (i.e. paddle height becomes 0), the game is over and a result screen appears. Therefore, the winner is who still has the paddle at the end.
